Installation
=====================================

Wotan can be installed conveniently using pip::

    pip install wotan

If you have multiple versions of Python and pip on your machine, make sure to use pip3. Try::

    pip3 install wotan


The latest version can be pulled from github::

    git clone https://github.com/hippke/wotan.git
    cd wotan
    python setup.py install

If the command ``python`` does not point to Python 3 on your machine, you can try to replace the last line with ``python3 setup.py install``. If you don't have ``git`` on your machine, you can find installation instructions `here <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_.


Compatibility
------------------------

Wotan has been `tested to work <https://travis-ci.com/hippke/wotan>`_ with Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7.
