...is a free and open source algorithm to automagically remove stellar trends from light curves for exoplanet transit detection.

In Germanic mythology, Odin (/ˈoːðinː/ Old High German: Wōtan) is a widely revered god. He gave one of his eyes to Mimir in return for wisdom. Thus, in order to achieve a goal, one sometimes has to turn a blind eye. In Richard Wagner's "Der Ring des Nibelungen", Wotan is the King of the Gods (god of light, air, and wind) and a bass-baritone. According to Wagner, he is the "pinnacle of intelligence".
