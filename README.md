# Wōtan

Wōtan is a free and open source algorithm to automagically remove stellar trends from light curves, making them ready for exoplanet transit detection.

In Germanic mythology, Odin (Old High German: Wōtan) is a widely revered god. He gave one of his eyes to Mimir in return for wisdom. Thus, in order to achieve a goal, one sometimes has to turn a blind eye.
